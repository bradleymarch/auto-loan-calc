# auto-loan-calc

Yep so here is some deets:


CHALLENGE

Use the following inputs:
Car price.
Downpayment.
Interest rate.
Return the following:
Estimated monthly payment.
Total interest paid (over the duration of the loan).

SOLUTION

I used jQuery to keep things simple.
For the inputs I created variables based on jQuery element selectors values.
I did some math operations to produce what is needed to be returned.
I styled the elmemnts a bit.
I sent a message of an alert on submit (for the return portion) that contained the
total interest and monthly payment.
